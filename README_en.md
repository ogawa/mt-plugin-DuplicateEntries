## Overview

The duplicated items will be complete copies of the original items, except duplicated entries and pages will be created as ''draft'' items.

This plugin is designed to work with Movable Type version 4.0 or later.

## How To Install

 - Upload or copy the "DuplicateEntries" directory into your "plugins" directory.
 - After proper installation, you will find "!DuplicateEntries" plugin listed on the "System Plugin Settings" screen.

 - First, go to "Manage Entries" screen (select "Entries" from "Manage" dropdown list).
 - Select one or more items you want to duplicate.
 - Select "Duplicate Entries" from "More action..." dropdown list, and click "Go" button.
 - (Probably) you'll find duplicated (and newly created) entries in "Manage Entries" screen.
